**Flaer Terms of Service and User Agreement**

- **Last Updated: December 2025**

  **Summary of Key Points (Plain-Language Overview)**
  _This summary is provided for convenience only. The full Terms of Service below are the legally binding agreement._

  • **What Flaer Is**
  Flaer allows Users to share authentic Instagram posts or stories about businesses and potentially earn money based on performance.

  • **Data You Authorize**
  Flaer accesses only the Instagram data you explicitly grant permission for. This data is used to verify your content, retrieve insights, calculate rewards, and maintain platform integrity. Flaer does not track you across other apps or websites.

  • **Your Agreement**
  By using Flaer, you agree to these Terms, Instagram’s rules, and all content and safety policies. You may monetize only content you own that accurately represents the business you select.

  • **Content and Safety Standards**
  Flaer does not allow or monetize adult content, violence, hate, illegal activity, or any content prohibited by Apple App Store Review Guidelines or Instagram policies.

  • **How Rewards Work**
  Businesses fund their accounts using Stripe. You earn money only after Instagram insights are successfully retrieved and validated. Estimated rewards are not guaranteed.

  • **Your Responsibilities**
  You must maintain valid Instagram access. Deleting posts, revoking permissions, or violating policies may result in unrewarded Shares or account termination. Fraud, bots, fake engagement, or manipulation are strictly prohibited.

  • **Advertiser Responsibilities**
  Businesses must maintain adequate credit balances, provide accurate information, and follow all advertising rules. Credit purchases are non-refundable unless required by law.

  • **No Guaranteed Earnings**
  Reward amounts depend on actual post performance. Flaer does not guarantee that any User will earn money.

  • **Third-Party Dependencies**
  Flaer relies on Instagram, Stripe, AWS, and your device’s operating system. Outages, API limitations, or platform failures may affect functionality or reward calculations.

  • **Your Rights**
  You may delete your Flaer account at any time. Flaer will remove your Instagram data unless retention is required for legal or audit purposes.

  • **Dispute Resolution**
  Users must attempt informal resolution first. U.S. Users agree to binding arbitration and waive participation in class actions.

By using Flaer, you agree to comply with all platform rules, eligibility requirements, and technical limitations described in these Terms.

## **3.1 Account Registration**

\(a\) Users

To create a Flaer account, Users must initially authenticate through **Instagram**.  
After registration, Users may log in using Instagram or supported secondary authentication methods, such as email.

Users may maintain a Flaer account without an active Instagram connection; however, an Instagram connection is required to access certain features, including but not limited to monetization, content evaluation, and reward calculation.

\(b\) Advertisers

To create and access an Advertiser account, Advertisers must register and log in using an email address and password, or other methods expressly made available by Flaer.

Instagram authentication is not required for Advertiser accounts.

Users are responsible for keeping their Instagram access active.  
If Instagram permissions expire or are revoked:

Flaer is not responsible for losses caused by expired tokens, revoked permissions, or Instagram platform outages.

## **3.3 Multiple Shares and Frequency Limits**

Users may have multiple Shares pending evaluation or reward at the same time.  
However, Flaer may apply **frequency multipliers** or other algorithmic adjustments to reduce rewards if content is posted excessively or in a manner inconsistent with authentic engagement.

A Share is created only if:

1.  The User selects a business to monetize, **and **

2.  The Advertiser has sufficient available credits to fund the estimated reward.

If the business does not have enough credits, the User will see a message indicating that the Share cannot be monetized at this time.

Users cannot delete Shares inside Flaer.  
Shares may remain recorded within Flaer; however, associated content, media, Instagram identifiers, and insights may be removed or anonymized as a result of:
